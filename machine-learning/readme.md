### Breast Cancer Prediction Tool

In order to detect cancer, a pathologist examines the slide of tissue under a microscope. S/he visually ensures that there's no cancer and ultimately find malignant areas. We currently provide a tool powered by artifical intelligence which analyses hispathological image i.e. images of glass tissue slides under a microscope, here tissue samples from lymph nodes in order to detect breast cancer. We will be analysing tissues for:

* **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma** - This is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. Almost 80% of diagnosed breast cancers are of this subtype.
* **Metastatic Cancer** - A metastatic cancer or metastatic tumor is one that has spread from the site where it started into different area/s of the body.

We  use the 'Breast Histopathology Images' dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection.

* **IDC_model** 
    * Accuracy: 0.88
    * F1 Score: 0.88

* **Metastatic_model** 
    * Accuracy: 0.94
    * F1 Score: 0.94


### Chatbot

We welcome our users with a friend to talk to! We give them an encouraging start and a pal to talk to! this chatbot has been created using **DialogFlow** and has been trained to talk to people who maybe facing mental health issues in an encouraging and helpful manner. :)

A conversation may look like as follows: It maybe noted that it will not be the same every time and each conversation created more data to train on thereby improving the model!
